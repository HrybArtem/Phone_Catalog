React Phone Catalog
This project is a fully functional mobile phone catalog application, developed to showcase my skills in modern frontend development. It demonstrates proficiency in creating dynamic, performant, and well-structured web applications.

Key Technologies and Features
React (v18.x) & TypeScript: Utilizing TypeScript for strong typing ensures high code quality, improves maintainability, and reduces development errors. React forms the foundation for building a component-based and reactive user interface.

Routing: react-router-dom (v6.x) is integrated to create clean URLs and implement a SPA (Single Page Application), allowing for fast transitions between the main catalog, product details, and other sections.

Styling and UI:

SCSS Modules: Styling is implemented using modular SCSS (Sass), guaranteeing local scope for styles and preventing conflicts, leading to more organized CSS code.

Dynamic Components: Libraries for sliders (embla-carousel-react, react-slick) are employed to create engaging product carousels or image galleries.

UI/UX Enhancements: Features like classnames for conditional class joining, react-spinners for loading indication, and react-transition-group for smooth animations are used to deliver an excellent user experience.

Code Quality and Development:

Linting and Formatting: ESLint, Stylelint, and Prettier are configured to automatically enforce high coding standards, adherence to common conventions, and a consistent style.

Build and Deployment: Modern tooling such as Vite (for fast development and optimized builds) and gh-pages (for streamlined deployment) are utilized.
